  <h2><a name="about" style="color:white;">About Me</a></h2>
  <p style="color:white;">I am a 16 year old high school student from the Poconos in a small town called East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. I am entering my junior year of high school. My first experience with computers was when I created a computer flash animation that narrated the story of Christopher Columbus in my 8th grade for a computer fair. I decided to take this step further by joining a Girls Who Code program. I enjoy coding because it is a way of being able to create something on your own. I think that it is really cool how you can create something with important functionality out of a blank screen. I also believe that it will become a very important skill for everyone to learn in the future. Along with enjoying to code, I also like to play the piano, play with my dogs, and I also volunteer regularly in my community as I am an active member of my school's Key Club. </p>
  
  <h2><a name="work" style="color:white;">Work Sample</a></h2>
  <p style="color:white;"> I learned a lot of new skills while attending the Girls Who Code Campus Program in Morristown, New Jersey. One of the skills I learned was how to incorporate loops with if/else statements. We did this through a short project we did in a day called an Ubbi Dubbi Translator. We had created a program that translates regular English words and sentences into Ubbi Dubbi for you. This is done by adding "ub" before every vowel in a word. </p>

  <h2><a name="learning" style="color:white;">Key Learning</a></h2>
  <p style="color:white;"> Along with learning a lot of technological skills relating to computers, I also learned a lot of valuable life skills while working with my teammates. One of the things I learned was the importance of communication when working within a team. I realized this when a group that I was working with didn't really feel comfortable talking to each other a lot. I realized this was a flaw because it became very difficult to get things done within our group. Another important skill I learned was the importance of asking questions. One of my teammates was always asking questions and was learning a lot along the way. I realized that asking questions is one of the only ways that you can learn and increase your knowledge about something.</p>
  
  <h2><a name="future" style="color:white;">Hope For My Future</a></h2>
  <p style="color:white;"> Being involved with computers and technology was something that I have been comfortable with since middle school and eventually ended up enjoying a lot. I hope to go to college for computer science and to pursue a career in front end development or software development. </p>
  
    <h2><a name="advice" style="color:white;">Advice</a></h2>
  <p style="color:white;"> Although I am nowhere near actually being able to experience a woman's experience in the actual tech industry, I do know a lot about it. Being in a male dominated field while being very nervous about not being good enough for everyone else or even sounding smart enough can be very scary. However, that should just be motivation to do ten times better than everyone else. Being a part of the Girls Who Code community has made it so much easier to understand the importance of sisterhood and support, which are two very important aspects to keep with you while pursuing computer science in the future. It is important to continually work hard, but don't bring down others in the process. Support, curiousity, and determination should be more than enough to make you become successful in not just computer science but it any difficult field that a young girl would be hesitant to go into. </p>
